# Beeper WinUI 3 Theme 🎨

</br>

This Beeper WinUI 3 Theme changes the theme of the Beeper Desktop application to match the WinUI 3 design language.

> [!NOTE]
> The new Beeper Desktop update (I do not know when this was introduced) introduced a new Emoji Picker, which broke the Emoji Picker styling.
> I am not able to find a way to fix this, it uses Shadow DOM styling which doesn't make it as easy to style these components.
> If you find a way to style the Emoji Picker, feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
